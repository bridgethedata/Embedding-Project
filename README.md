# Embedding-Project


Welcome to the Embedding Project! This project demonstrates the use of embedding techniques within a web application. It features a simple frontend interface styled with CSS and interactive functionality powered by JavaScript. The goal is to provide a clear example of how embeddings can be integrated and visualised in a web environment.


The project consists of the following key files:
index.html: The main HTML file that structures the web page.
app.js: JavaScript file containing the logic and functionality for interacting with embeddings.
styles.css: CSS file for styling the web page.
